# Patch Log v29

**Running change ledger aligned to the v29 master protocol · Updated: Session 2 hardening cycle (P-005, P-006, P-008)**

---

**Purpose.** This log records the hardening changes introduced during the current cycle and keeps a traceable link between threats, mitigations, introduced risks, and remaining open questions.

**Rule.** The patch log is not a substitute for the master. The master holds the law-like text; the patch log explains how and why the hardening evolved.

**Patch status convention:** 
- **ACTIVE** = adopted and awaiting simulation/tuning. 
- **SUPERSEDED** = replaced by a later patch. 
- **PROPOSED** = designed but not yet accepted into the master. 
- **RETIRED** = intentionally removed.

| P-001 | T-001 | **ACTIVE** | Critical | structural + behavioral detection + targeted enforcement. |

### P-001 — Shadow Convertibility Containment

- **Introduced design:** LC-only essential access, non-delegable redemption, context-locking where proportionate, anomaly detection, broker targeting, and an explicit leakage-tolerance concept.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Essential Access Exclusivity, Non-Delegable Consumption, Leakage Tolerance, Broker-Focused Enforcement.
- **Dependencies:** identity assurance, coercion reporting pathways, and sufficiently accurate essential-supply management.
- **New risks introduced:** over-surveillance, false positives, user friction, and migration of abuse into proxy-identity channels.
- **Residual risk:** small-scale favors and informal pooling remain acceptable if they do not scale into arbitrage infrastructure.

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-002 | T-004 | **ACTIVE** | Critical | economic + behavioral + contribution architecture. |

### P-002 — Incentive System Stabilization

- **Introduced design:** nonlinear reward curves, multi-channel rewards (EC, civic standing, status/recognition), opportunity access, time/flexibility rewards, and anti-gaming contribution assessment.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Incentive Nonlinearity, Multi-Channel Reward, Outcome-Based Contribution, Anti-Gaming Contribution.
- **Dependencies:** identity attribution, contribution verification, and governance rules for how civic standing can matter without becoming coercive privilege.
- **New risks introduced:** status hierarchy, burnout optimization, and domain bias toward easier-to-measure work.
- **Residual risk:** optimization behavior remains, but the design goal is to align it with contribution rather than suppress it.

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-003 | T-002 | **ACTIVE** | Critical | structural + security + continuity protection. |

### P-003 — Identity System Hardening

- **Introduced design:** four assurance tiers (humane floor, provisional, core, civic activation), multi-evidence thresholding, no master credential, hardened recovery, anti-Sybil controls, and no-survival-lockout under uncertainty.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Identity Adversarial Reality, Differential Assurance, Recovery Safety, No Master Credential, Identity Failure Continuity.
- **Dependencies:** appeals architecture, ombuds/advocate pathways, and clear separation between verification and monitoring.
- **New risks introduced:** complexity, onboarding friction, and slower recovery for legitimate edge cases if poorly implemented.
- **Residual risk:** low-level fraud remains possible and should be contained rather than denied in theory.

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-004 | T-007 | **ACTIVE** | Critical | governance + constitutional anti-capture control. |

### P-004 — Definition Drift Protection

- **Introduced design:** protected term classes, semantic effect test, worked-example requirement, public definition registry, upward classification default, and anti-laundering control across code, vendor, and standards layers.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Definition Integrity, Semantic Effect, Upward Classification Default, Worked Example Requirement, Definition Registry, Anti-Laundering.
- **Dependencies:** classification authority, change-control process, and review capacity.
- **New risks introduced:** process friction, slower iteration, and semantic bureaucracy if overbuilt.
- **Residual risk:** subtle drift can still occur unless registry, examples, and challenge windows are actually used.

## Session 2 Patches — Detailed Entries

**Status: PROPOSED.** These patches are not yet operative. They become operative only when formally integrated into the master protocol and status updated to ACTIVE.

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-005 | T-005 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | structural + procedural + monitoring |

### P-005 — Governance Throughput Hardening

- **Change type:** structural + procedural + monitoring.
- **Introduced design:** CRP dual-queue separation (constitutional vs. operational); minimum operational throughput floor (5 priority decisions per quarter, non-blockable by constitutional challenges); sequential emergency re-declaration cap (2 consecutive quarters max, requires independent audit and public justification to extend); intake throttle with priority scoring (impact × urgency × reversibility; DW-signal for urgency; overflow is public); cross-quarter interim authorization bridge (Ombuds + 1 rotating CRP member + regional exec; scope-locked to emergency declaration; provisional only; cannot narrow LC access or touch constitutional matters); decision quality audit metrics (alternatives-presented ratio, reversal rate, minority dissent rate); [Ambitious] real-time throughput dashboard with auto-escalation trigger.
- **Clauses to integrate:** CRP Dual-Queue Separation; Minimum Throughput Floor; Sequential Emergency Cap; Intake Throttle and Priority Scoring; Cross-Quarter Interim Bridge; Decision Quality Metrics. See Annex AC1.
- **Dependencies:** Annex L (CRP sub-panel composition); Annex T (simulation mandate extension); Pillar 5 compliance matrix; Level 3–4 emergency cascade table.
- **New risks introduced:** Operational sub-panel capture if composition predictable; interim bridge scope creep; priority scoring gaming; [ambitious] throughput dashboard exposure of vulnerability windows (mitigated by 48-hour publication lag).
- **Residual risk:** Throughput theater remains hard to detect. Patient actor can operate within throughput floors while maintaining effective paralysis through distributed delay across proposals.
- **Compound linkages:** T-005 × T-006 (PCRP window synchronization); T-005 × T-008 (PCRP authority as new power locus); T-005 × T-001 (paralysis extends cadence exploit windows).

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-006 | T-006 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | structural + authority definition + measurement architecture |

### P-006 — Measurement Lag and Supply Shock Hardening

- **Change type:** structural + authority definition + measurement architecture.
- **Introduced design:** Sentinel indicator mandate — every slow-audit essential category requires a faster low-fidelity signal; max lag by volatility class (48h high / 7d medium / 30d low). Pre-Confirmation Response Protocol (PCRP) — defined first-responder authority (Regional Executive Body, joint activation); permitted: 70% above-baseline issuance reduction, reserve release, expedited oracle review (humane floor issuance stays 100%); prohibited: full SQ, humane floor narrowing, other categories, beyond 72h without oracle confirmation; false-trigger tracking — 3 false activations per 4 quarters triggers mandatory independent audit. SQ unwind symmetry — recovery fast-track mirrors PCRP; conservative bias applies to activation, not prolonged restriction after recovery. Cadence-adjusted U8 bridge — 48-hour trigger for high-volatility categories; 7-day retained for medium-volatility. [Ambitious] LC redemption velocity as native sentinel (150% spike threshold). [Ambitious] Cross-category demand surge detector.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Sentinel Indicator Mandate; PCRP; PCRP Scope Definition (protected term under P-004); SQ Unwind Symmetry; Cadence-Adjusted U8 Bridge. See Annex AC2.
- **Dependencies:** Regional Executive Body formally constituted with joint-activation rules. LC ledger redemption velocity in privacy-preserving aggregate form. Annex M extended with cadence floors. Annex U8 modified.
- **New risks introduced:** PCRP soft-power weaponization; two-source corroboration gaming; recovery fast-track exploit via manufactured sentinel signals; [ambitious] LC velocity oracle suppression gaming (mitigated by anomaly detection on suppression patterns).
- **Residual risk:** Inter-cycle gap is compressed not eliminated. 'Supply shock' must be a protected term under P-004 with worked examples to prevent scope creep.
- **Compound linkages:** T-006 × T-001 (cadence windows = black market opportunity); T-006 × T-005 (PCRP window synchronization); T-006 × T-008 (PCRP authority at REB = elite formation risk).

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-008 | T-008 | **PROPOSED** | High | structural + measurement + institutional design |

### P-008 — Bureaucratic Elite Formation Hardening

- **Change type:** structural + measurement + institutional design.
- **Introduced design:** Legibility gap audit — quarterly Pillar 8 report tracks verification approval rate, evidence burden, appeals rate, and abandonment rate by contribution category; 20-point disparity triggers independent process audit (not by incumbent verifier pool). CR sector ceiling specification mandate — max 25% per sector, max 35% per identifiable institutional-origin cluster in any CR-governed service pool; specified at founding as precondition under Annex N. Epistemic diversity requirement — three-axis standard (institutional origin ≤30%, contribution-type diversity ≥30% informal/care, geography ≥25% non-urban-dense) for all oversight bodies >5 members; pool design requirement. Verification independence rule — verifiers cannot review claims in own primary contribution category; applies to mid-range and above claims. Cooling-off cohort rule — cohort tracking by Ombuds Office; max 2 cohort members sharing review authority over same subject simultaneously. [Ambitious] Qualification standard governance — competence criteria added to P-004 protected terms registry; standard-setting body must include ≥40% from non-qualifying backgrounds. [Ambitious] Real-time concentration dashboard.
- **Clauses to integrate:** Legibility Gap Audit; CR Sector Ceiling Specification (founding precondition Annex N); Epistemic Diversity Requirement; Verification Independence Rule; Cooling-Off Cohort Rule; Qualification Standard Governance (P-004 extension); Concentration Dashboard. See Annex AC3.
- **Dependencies:** CR sector ceilings specified at founding (pre-CRP constitution). Pillar 8 U7 extended for verifier category independence. P-004 protected terms registry extended. Pool-depth health metrics added to Pillar 11.
- **New risks introduced:** Epistemic diversity pool-depth constraint interacts with P-005 throughput vulnerability. Verification independence adds legitimate friction to high-impact claims. Cohort tracking system is a power locus if Ombuds Office itself captured. [Ambitious] concentration dashboard gaming below thresholds (mitigated by 30-day data lag).
- **Residual risk:** Class formation through informal social networks has no hard control. Open question: Ombuds Office carries three load-bearing functions (cohort tracking, legibility audit, diversity certification) — if Ombuds becomes an elite formation site all three are compromised. Who audits the auditors of elite formation?
- **Compound linkages:** T-008 × T-011 (elite formation creates narrative attack surface; P-008 dashboard provides defense evidence base); T-008 × T-005 (PCRP authority concentration); T-008 × T-006 (PCRP regional bodies subject to elite formation).

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-011 | T-011 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | communication architecture + transparency + pre-commitment |

### P-011 — Narrative Attack Surface Hardening

- **Change type:** communication architecture + transparency + pre-commitment doctrine.
- **Introduced design:** Rapid Public Communication Protocol (RPCP) — 4-hour structured template for any public-visibility operational event; covers what happened, system response, access status, next steps; does not replace 7-day post-mortem; pre-authorized publication authority required. Pre-committed failure communication doctrine — published pre-launch document acknowledging expected failures (PCRP false triggers, oracle disputes, SQ activations, enforcement errors, measurement uncertainty) with containment mechanisms; converts failures from surprises to acknowledged expected events. Citizen-Facing Rights Layer (CFRL) — one page, 8th-grade level, pre-launch, translated; governed as P-004 protected specification. Adversarial Narrative Simulation — added to Annex T annual mandate; hostile framing team publishes simulated attack; system responds within 4 hours; report published. Hostile Frame Pre-emption Registry — top 10 mischaracterizations with accurate rebuttals and Pillar 11 evidence; updated quarterly; published as 'Common Misunderstandings.' [Ambitious] Narrative Health Dashboard — public understanding accuracy surveys, hostile framing prevalence index, RPCP response time metric; Level 1 watch auto-trigger. [Ambitious] Pre-Launch Narrative Audit — independent adversarial audit by communications professionals; findings and mitigations published simultaneously.
- **Clauses to integrate:** RPCP; Pre-Committed Failure Doctrine; CFRL (P-004 protected spec); Adversarial Narrative Simulation (Annex T extension); Hostile Frame Registry. See Annex AD.
- **Dependencies:** P-008 ACTIVE is prerequisite for elite formation narrative rebuttal. Pillar 11 infrastructure must support 4-hour publication SLA. White Paper sync required before launch (AD6). CFRL added to P-004 protected terms registry.
- **New risks introduced:** Pre-committed failure document weaponized to prime failure expectation — mitigated by simultaneous publication of containment mechanisms. CFRL creates false certainty — mitigated by 'master protocol governs' disclaimer. ANS report as hostile playbook — mitigated by publishing after exercise completion. Hostile frame registry amplifies framings — mitigated by 'common misunderstandings' framing.
- **Residual risk:** Narrative defense is bounded by actual system performance. No communication architecture survives sustained failure. Pre-launch framing window (18+ months before launch) cannot be closed by protocol — only by early CFRL and pre-commitment doctrine deployment.
- **Compound linkages:** T-011 × T-008 (elite formation is factual hook for 'captured by professionals' narrative; P-008 concentration dashboard is the counter-narrative evidence base). T-011 × T-006 (PCRP false triggers are the highest-visibility predictable failure). T-011 × T-005 (governance paralysis generates narrative events).

| P-012 | T-012/013/014/015 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | structural + protocol + measurement |

### P-012 — Interface Hardening and Deadlock Prevention

- **Change type:** structural + protocol + measurement architecture.
- **Introduced design:** PCRP oracle independence requirement — two-source corroboration must use structurally independent measurement systems; manipulated oracle counts as one source regardless of downstream channels; single-source PCRP activates at reduced scope with Ombuds co-certification. Categorical throughput minimums — P-005 floor amended from single aggregate to 5 categorical minimums (identity, supply, enforcement, governance, unreserved); single category capped at 3 of 5 slots. Emergency deadlock resolution protocol — auto-declaration when mandatory decision is blocked by 2+ valid processes; 3-member arbitration panel within 6 hours; humane floor bridge unconditional; scope freeze; mandatory root-cause review. Demand-context flag for LC velocity oracle — discount applied during EC enforcement actions, mass re-verification campaigns, or regional defection; Ombuds co-certification required for PCRP. RPCP contested-status template — separates physical event from legal characterization during active CRP review. Cumulative procedural drift trigger — extends P-004 to 20 Tier 3 decisions in 8 quarters reducing Tier 2/1 decision space; triggers mandatory CRP cumulative review.
- **Clauses to integrate:** AE2.1–AE2.6. Amends AC1.2 (throughput floor), AC2.2 (PCRP), AD1 (RPCP), AB5 (P-004 drift).
- **Dependencies:** Pillar 10 demand-context register (new data feed); RPCP contested-status template library extension; CRP cumulative review procedure.
- **New risks introduced:** Deadlock panel engineered as bypass route — bad actors deliberately trigger triple-block to force panel arbitration. Demand-context flag delays legitimate PCRP during enforcement periods. Categorical floor gaming — proposals reframed to occupy minimum category slots. Cumulative drift review weaponized against legitimate operational evolution.
- **Residual risk:** Second-generation deadlock has no defined resolution beyond Level 5 structural review. T-009 (Grace Exploitation Loop) remains OPEN and is the next hardening target.
- **Compound linkages:** All of T-012/013/014/015 inter-linked through PCRP, throughput floor, and deadlock protocol.

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-009 | T-009 | **PROPOSED** | Med-High | behavioral + verification + structural |

### P-009 — Grace Exploitation Loop Hardening

- **Change type:** behavioral + verification architecture + structural.
- **Introduced design:** Graduated renewal intensity — first activation lightweight; first renewal structured; second renewal mid-intensity with support service confirmation; third+ renewal high-intensity independent panel. All qualifying hardship approved under any standard. Cross-quarter history review — full pause history assessed at every renewal; category switching flagged for elevated scrutiny at next renewal. Hardship attestation collusion detection — P-002 analytics extended to hardship networks; detects mutual pairs, star clusters, temporal clustering; community-disaster safe harbor for 2 quarters on oracle-verified regional emergency. CR slow-decay at 20% of normal rate during pause — DW freeze unchanged; 4-quarter pause produces ~8% CR loss (negligible); 12-quarter rotation produces ~22% loss (drains high-impact threshold). Service pool pause-saturation monitoring — >20% simultaneous pause triggers pool-health alert and review; never bars individual activation. [Ambitious] Capability development pathway — up to 15% quarterly CR earnable through pause-appropriate stewardship during pause. [Ambitious] T-009 × P-008 explicit closure — paused cohort members count toward P-008 cohort cooling concurrent maximum; active members accommodate, not paused person.
- **Clauses to integrate:** AF1–AF7. Annex K4 amended (graduated renewal; CR slow-decay). P-002 analytics extended (AF3). AC3.5 amended (AF7). Pillar 11 dashboard extended (AF5).
- **Dependencies:** P-002 collusion analytics infrastructure extended to hardship attestation graph. CR slow-decay rate requires Pillar 8 / Annex K4 protocol-level calibration. P-011 CFRL must communicate graduated renewal clearly before launch. [Ambitious] P-004 registry: 'pause-appropriate stewardship' as protected term. [Ambitious] P-008 AC3.5 amended per AF7.
- **New risks introduced:** Graduated renewal deters genuine long-term hardship if perceived as punitive — mitigated by CFRL communication and calibration. CR slow-decay may deter activation — mitigated by clear communication and negligible 4-quarter loss. Community-disaster safe harbor exploitable by manufactured disaster claims — mitigated by oracle verification requirement. Pool saturation monitoring creates perverse incentive against legitimate pause at bad timing — mitigated by review-only trigger.
- **Residual risk:** Involuntary unemployment category remains most exploitable — disproof requires intrusive investigation incompatible with non-surveillance commitment. Accept as contained leakage: graduate renewal intensity is the best available control. Low-level 1-2 quarter grace exploitation is acceptable system leakage — the cost of genuinely frictionless access for legitimate hardship.
- **Compound linkages:** T-009 × T-008 (primary bypass route for P-008 controls — AF7 closes it); T-009 × T-011 (graduated renewal must be communicated through CFRL or becomes narrative attack surface).

| P-013 | T-016 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | structural + governance + audit architecture |

### P-013 — Formal Acceptance Process Integrity

- **Change type:** structural + governance + audit architecture.
- **Introduced design:** Pilot representativeness standard — pilot region requires published 4-dimension assessment; >1 favorable dimension requires second stress-tested region; single favorable region = PILOT only, not ACTIVE. Deadlock resolution timeline — 30d negotiation, 60d published mediation, day 61 CRP binding ruling (14-day SLA); substitute review if CRP is party. Audit epistemic independence — 4-year institutional affiliation bar; domain-diversity requirement; adversarial audit member for I=5 patches (multi-member team, no veto). Anti-gaming constitutional upgrade — evidence waiver prohibition reclassified Tier 2; urgency bypass now requires H-2 amendment process. Stagnation documentation quality — 3-question review (accurate? progress? resolvable?); structural obstacles trigger bootstrap review not continued documentation. [Ambitious] Bootstrap Resolution Protocol — minimum viable bootstrap micro-patch for circular dependencies; 2-authority expedited sign-off; auto-sunset; P-008 legibility gap audit as first bootstrap candidate. [Ambitious] FAP concentration controls — cohort cooling on sign-off cluster; audit body meets AC3.3 diversity standard; independent Pillar 11 monitoring (not Ombuds-managed).
- **Clauses to integrate:** AG1–AG7. FAP document amended directly. Anti-gaming rules reclassified Tier 2 (H-2 required for amendment). Representativeness criteria added to P-004 protected terms registry.
- **Dependencies:** P-005 categorical floor extended to include FAP deadlock resolution slot. P-004 protected terms registry extended for representativeness criteria. P-008 AC3.3 epistemic diversity standard referenced for audit body. Pillar 11 AC3.7 concentration dashboard extended for FAP sign-off cluster. Independent concentration monitoring (not Ombuds) required before FAP becomes operative.
- **New risks introduced:** Two-region pilot requirement increases cost and time; 'close enough' stress-tested region designation risk (mitigated by published representativeness assessment). 60-day deadlock window creates operational gap (mitigated by Annex C-6 emergency patching remaining available as separate pathway). Adversarial auditor produces hostile reports (mitigated by multi-member team). [Ambitious] Bootstrap micro-patch normalized as general bypass channel (mitigated by 2-authority sign-off, humane floor requirement, auto-sunset). [Ambitious] FAP concentration controls risk infinite regress (mitigated by self-executing Pillar 11 publication).
- **Residual risk:** Evidence farming in stress-tested pilot region remains possible if representativeness assessment criteria are gamed at the definition stage — criteria require P-004 protection. Deadlock resolution creates new CRP workload at day 61; if CRP is congested (T-005 risk), the deadline may not be met — P-005 categorical floor must include FAP deadlock as a guaranteed slot. At root: the FAP cannot be made exploitation-proof without being made unusable. P-013 accepts this and chooses calibrated friction over either extreme.
- **Compound linkages:** T-016 × T-005 (deadlock resolution congests CRP; P-005 floor must accommodate). T-016 × T-008 (audit capture via intellectual-cousin exploit — closed by AG3). T-016 × T-011 (stagnation of critical patches is narrative attack: 'the system cannot fix itself').

| Patch ID | Related Threat | Status | Priority | Change Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P-014 | T-017 | **PROPOSED** | Critical | founding governance + one-time exception |

### P-014 — P-013 Bootstrap Activation (One-Time Founding Instrument)

**Special status.** P-014 is not a standing patch. It is a one-time founding instrument. It has no standing effect after P-013 reaches ACTIVE. It closes permanently upon P-013 activation.

- **Nature:** One-time founding instrument, not a standing patch. Closes permanently upon P-013 ACTIVE.
- **Change type:** founding governance + constitutional one-time exception.
- **Introduced design:** 5-stage process: (1) Pre-activation disclosure — 14-day public challenge window; circular dependency analysis published; founding exception statement from Threat Register Owner; panel composition disclosed before sign-off. (2) Heightened 5-member panel — Threat Register Owner, 1 CRP reserve member (lot-drawn, not involved in P-013 design), 1 external systems reviewer from outside design-team domain, 1 Ombuds officer, 1 public-interest advocate (lot-drawn). All attest no 5-year affiliation with design team (externally verified). Adversarial member required; dissent published. 4/5 votes required. (3) Substitute evidence — desk review of 3+ real-world analogue cases; adversarial red-team analysis; scope-limitation certification; sunset compatibility check. (4) Activation and permanent sealing — P-013 ACTIVE; P-014 closes permanently; full activation record published; non-precedent statement embedded with Tier 2 protection; P-006 and P-009 immediately enter FAP v2 pilot stage. (5) Post-activation audit within 90 days — using P-013's own now-operative standards; adversarial member required; if compromised → P-013 suspended and re-submitted through FAP v2.
- **Non-precedent statement (Tier 2 protected):** 'P-014 was invoked once, for P-013 only, because no other process was available. It may not be cited as authority for any future activation, exception, or urgency bypass. Any invocation of P-014 logic for any purpose requires H-2 amendment process.'
- **Clauses to integrate:** AH1–AH7. Annex N/U2 as constitutional anchor.
- **New risks introduced:** Founding panel subject to capture during 14-day pre-activation window (mitigated by lot-drawing, external conflict verification, adversarial member). Post-activation audit finding of compromise suspends P-013 — creates a window where FAP v2 is operative but its governing patch is suspended (mitigated by FAP v1 fallback during suspension; suspension published immediately). Pre-activation disclosure creates 14-day hostile narrative window (mitigated by framing as transparency demonstration).
- **Residual risk:** Desk review cases may be selected to confirm rather than challenge P-013 — adversarial member's case selection is the primary control; cases published for independent scrutiny. Second-order self-reference if post-activation audit finds compromise — accepted as less circular than the original bootstrap problem.
- **Auto-close clause:** P-014 closes permanently upon P-013 ACTIVE status. No re-opening, no emergency extension, no analogical application. This clause is Tier 2 protected.
- **Compound linkages:** T-017 × T-016 (bootstrap paradox is the exploit surface T-016 bad actors use for indefinite delay of P-013). T-017 × T-011 (bootstrap paradox is a narrative attack surface — P-014 pre-activation disclosure converts it into a transparency demonstration).

## Operating Rules for the Patch Log

- Every future patch must reference a threat ID and specify the new risk it creates.
- If a patch only exists in the log and not in the master, it is not yet operative.
- If a patch changes public explanation, the white paper and technical reference must be synced in the same cycle.
- When a patch materially changes user experience or institutional authority, the diagram set must be updated too.
- **PROPOSED** patches become ACTIVE only after formal master protocol integration and oversight sign-off.
- If two patches conflict, the conflict belongs in the patch log and must be resolved explicitly in the master protocol.
