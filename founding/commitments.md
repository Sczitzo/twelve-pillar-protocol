# Founding Commitments — Numerical Lock File

**Status:** Tier 1 / Tier 2 mixed (per row). Published as single authoritative source.
**Purpose:** Closes Proposal 4 of `Protocol_Optimization_Proposals.md`. Every founding parameter referenced across the Humane Constitution, White Paper, Threat Register, Patch Log, and annexes is either bound to a value here or assigned a reserved FC identifier here until the activation gate that binds it.
**Amendment:** Tier 1 commitments require H-3 refounding authority. Tier 2 commitments follow the ordinary amendment ladder with public redlines. Tier 3 commitments follow ordinary reasonableness review.

**Naming note:** The live constitutional presentation uses **one Founding Order** and **Articles I-VII**. The "Affected docs" column may still use legacy pillar or `P0` shorthand for traceability.

## Derivation Notes

**FC-020 (`PROTECTED_PAUSE_FLOOR = 0.30`).** Sim Test 7 in `docs/ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.md` established:
- Caregiver-at-2%-contribution DW equilibrium = 0.13 units.
- Standard-at-10%-contribution DW equilibrium = 0.67 units.
- Protected Pause at 20% decay dampening = 4.44 units (exploitable if set there).

Floor value must satisfy: above the exposed-caregiver equilibrium (0.13) to provide real voice; below the standard-contributor equilibrium (0.67) to prevent pause-as-exploit. **0.30** sits ≈33% of the way up this band — meaningful protection without civic premium for pausing.

**FC-060 (`DW_SECTOR_CEILING = 0.20`).** From Sim Test 4: for N=5 sectors with ceiling c, supermajority (≥2/3) is achievable via k-sector coalition when k·c ≥ 2/3. Setting c = 0.20, maximum 3-sector coalition = 0.60 < 0.667 — no 3-sector supermajority possible. Preserves margin against measurement imprecision.

**FC-030 / FC-031 (Oracle parameters).** BFT theorem: n ≥ 3f+1 for tolerance of f faulty nodes. At f = 1: n ≥ 4. **FC-030 = 5** provides margin of one node above the floor, tolerates single-node loss without immediately dropping below BFT. FC-031 = 3 methodology classes guarantees diversity even when one class is simultaneously compromised.

**FC-040 (`BRIBE_DETERRENCE_MULTIPLIER = 5.0`).** Sim Test 5: at 85% detection, penalty = 0.18× gain is break-even. Setting penalty = 5× gain produces expected value = −(0.85 × 5 − 0.15 × 1) × gain = −4.1× gain. Margin of safety permits detection probability as low as 25% before deterrent fails.

**FC-110 / FC-111 (Tier 1 amendment parameters).** Distributed key-holder count of 9 balances resilience against loss (can lose 2 without breakage) versus capture resistance (must capture ≥3 to prevent amendment, ≥7 to force amendment). Timelock of 180 days ensures any captured supermajority survives at least one political cycle before amendment effect — enables reversal proposal by uncaptured parties.

## Hash Commitment

At founding, the SHA-256 hash of this file (computed with the canonical line-ending, UTF-8 encoding, and without trailing whitespace normalization) is committed to the ledger genesis block. Subsequent amendments produce new hash commitments with version-chained history per `/architecture/drift_chain.md`.

**Genesis commitment:** TBD at founding event. Computed by the founding coalition's multi-signature process.
